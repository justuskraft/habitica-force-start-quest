# habitica-force-start-quest
This script force starts a pending quest after a set time e.g. 1 hour. It is best used in combination with the auto accept quest script. That way everyone who wants to participate in the quest can do so by enabling auto accept quest and if some people don't want to take part the quest owner doesn't have to start the quest after set time manually.
